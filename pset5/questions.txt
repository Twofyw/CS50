0.  An example of maximum length for a word
1.  getrusage gets information about resource utilization
2.  Because the rusage structure is kind of big so passing it by reference instead of copying it avoids resource waste.
3.  In each iteration, the for loop reads a character from text and store it in variable c. Then the multiple if conditions put the letter characters into a word or simply ignore others to prepare a word ready for spell check.
4.  fscanf doesn't check if the string read is a word or number or anything else so the spell checker may receive something that is not consisted of letters.
5.  A constant cannot be modified so that it won't be changed anyhow.
/ind
6.  Trie. Each node consists of a mark, "isWord", to mark the end of a word is reached, and 27 children nodes that indicates whether the letter exsists in the dictionary or not and enable the structure to accept another letter afterwards.
7.  It took 2.5x the time of the staff's solution when checking texts/austinpowers.txt.
8.  I use malloc instead of calloc since it doesn't errs even I don't zero the memory using malloc.
9.  Yes. The structure used by a trie is too large do loading dictionary takes too much time.
10. TODO
